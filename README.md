# 🧠 NeuroText Shield

**NeuroText Shield** is a lightweight, real-time email classifier designed to detect spam and phishing emails. This project was developed by a team of five during the **CS Girlies Hackathon – A.I vs H.I**, where we explored the intersection of artificial intelligence and human intuition to build a socially impactful product.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Phishing emails and spam messages continue to be a growing threat in the digital world. NeuroText Shield offers a simple but effective solution to pre-filter and flag such emails using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques. It was built with the aim of making digital communication safer, especially for non-tech-savvy users.
